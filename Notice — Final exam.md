## Development Update – May 2025

Due to final exams and summer fieldwork obligations, development will temporarily slow down.

Full focus on TreeOS / Signal / SapClarify will resume in the summer (from July onward), with all core architecture work continuing as planned.

Thank you for your patience and quiet support.
