# TreeOS: Deterministic Path-Based Operating System

**TreeOS** is a modular operating system designed from first principles to eliminate traditional race conditions, permission arbitration, and black-box execution. It introduces a deterministic path execution model, powered by the **SapClarify** stream control protocol and the low-level **Signal** language.

---

## Core Philosophy

- **No shared memory contention**  
- **No syscall-based runtime arbitration**  
- **No opaque drivers or schedulers**  

Instead, every execution branch is a self-contained **path** with predefined memory, compute, and I/O scope.

---

## System Architecture

- **Leaf-based execution model**: All computation is performed by modular leaf nodes linked via TreeOS paths.
- **SapClarify stream**: Translates user intent (typed or spoken) into structured execution directives.
- **Signal language**: Ultra-low-level, page-aligned instruction system with deterministic memory lifecycle.

---

## Highlights

- Supports **multi-version compilation** of external languages with zero namespace conflict.
- Integrated logging for **full-memory traceability** at runtime.
- Tailored for **multi-chip GPU**, **optical DMA**, and **fluid-matrix rendering** in future architectures.

---

## Status

This repository contains a technical overview. Core components are in development and will be staged separately:
- `SapClarify` repo (stream logic)
- `Signal` repo (language + assembler)
- Hardware interface designs (multi-chip GPU, optical interconnect)
