Hello everyone,

Just a quick update — I’ve been feeling unwell these past few days and will need a bit of time to rest and recover. As a result, there won’t be any new updates or responses for a short while.

Thank you for your understanding and patience. I’ll resume work as soon as I’m feeling better.

The project is very much alive — just taking a short breath.

Take care,
Shizuka
